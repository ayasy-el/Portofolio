# Restaurant Ordering System

[Link To Project](https://github.com/ayasy-el/Restaurant_Cmysql)

## Project Overview

This project is a **Restaurant Ordering System** designed to streamline the ordering process in restaurants. It involves the use of **C/C++**, **MySQL**, **Makefile**, and **CMake**. The system integrates multiple features such as menu management, order processing, and employee management, with a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

1. Understand the functionality of a restaurant ordering system involving **functions**, **arrays**, **strings**, and **pointers**.
2. Design and implement the system to manage menu, customer orders, total pricing, and order history.
3. Utilize **C/C++**, **MySQL**, **Makefile**, and **CMake** for development and deployment.

## Tools and Technologies

- **C/C++**: A general-purpose programming language with efficient memory manipulation and portability.
- **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management system for handling menu data, customer orders, and order history.
- **Makefile**: Automates the build process, allowing for efficient compilation and execution.
- **CMake**: A cross-platform tool for automating the build process.

## Application Features

1. **Login Page**: Secure login system for user authentication.
2. **POS Main Menu**: Main interface for processing customer orders.
3. **Add Orders**: Functionality to add customer orders.
4. **Manage Menu**: Admin can add, edit, or remove items from the menu.
5. **Order History**: Displays all past orders.
6. **EMS (Employee Management System)**: Allows adding, editing, and deleting employee records.

## Database Structure

- The system uses **MySQL** to manage restaurant data such as menu items, customer orders, and employee records.

## Installation Guide

### For Windows:

Ensure **GCC**, **Makefile**, **CMake**, and **MySQL** are installed.

### For Linux (Debian Based):

Ensure **mysqlclient** is installed by running:

```bash
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev
```

### Build Process:

1. Build both the restaurant and employee systems:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
2. To build and run the **employee management system**:
   ```bash
   make k
   make run-k
   ```
3. To build and run the **restaurant ordering system**:
   ```bash
   make r
   make run-r
   ```

## Analysis

The project demonstrates the implementation of a **Point of Sale (POS)** system for restaurants using **C/C++**. It efficiently manages menu items, orders, and employee data with the help of **MySQL** for database management. The integration of **Makefile** automates the build process, and **CMake** ensures cross-platform compatibility.

Key programming concepts used:

- **Arrays**: Store customer order data.
- **Functions**: Calculate total order prices and manage customer data.
- **Strings**: Store customer names and menu items.
- **Pointers**: Access data stored in memory.
